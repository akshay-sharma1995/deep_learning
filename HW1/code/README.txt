Programming Q1:
To run the code use the following command:

Training:
python p1.py

The results will be saved in the same folder as the code with names: "p1_model.pkl" for the saved model, and "p1.png" for the training results

Evaluating saved model:
To just evaluate a saved model use:
python p1.py --just-eval 1 --model-path ./p1_model.npz

Programming Q2:
To run the code use the following command:

Training:
python p2.py

This will run the code with the default settings for the hyperparameters
The results will be saved in the same folder as "p2.py" with names: "p2_model.pkl" for the saved model, and "p2_train_loss.png", "p2_test_accuracy.png" for the plots

Evaluating saved model:
To just evaluate a saved model use:
python p2.py --just-eval 1 --model-path ./p2_model.pkl
